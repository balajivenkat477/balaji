                The task has two parts.

                We have an object:
                
                let head = {
                  glasses: 1
                };
                
                let table = {
                  pen: 3
                };
                
                let bed = {
                  sheet: 1,
                  pillow: 2
                };
                
                let pockets = {
                  money: 2000
                };
                Use __proto__ to assign prototypes in a way that any property lookup will follow the path: pockets → bed → table → head. For instance, pockets.pen should be 3 (found in table), and bed.glasses should be 1 (found in head).
                Answer the question: is it faster to get glasses as pockets.glasses or head.glasses? Benchmark if needed.
