    <p>Write a function getSecondsToday() that returns the number of seconds from the beginning of today.

    For instance, if now 10:00 am, and there was no daylight savings shift, then:

    getSecondsToday() == 36000 // (3600 * 10)
    The function should work in any day. That is, it should not have a hard-coded value of “today”.<p>
