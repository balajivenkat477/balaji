                We have a built-in method arr.filter(f) for arrays. It filters all elements through the function f. If it returns true, then that element is returned in the resulting array.

                Make a set of “ready to use” filters:
                
                inBetween(a, b) – between a and b or equal to them (inclusively).
                inArray([...]) – in the given array.
                The usage must be like this:
                
                arr.filter(inBetween(3,6)) – selects only values between 3 and 6.
                arr.filter(inArray([1,2,3])) – selects only elements matching with one of the members of [1,2,3].
                For instance:
                
                /* .. your code for inBetween and inArray */
                let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
                
                alert( arr.filter(inBetween(3, 6)) ); // 3,4,5,6
                
                alert( arr.filter(inArray([1, 2, 10])) ); // 1,2
        </p>
    </body>
