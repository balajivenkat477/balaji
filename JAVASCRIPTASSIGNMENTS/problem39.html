    <p>There’s an array of messages as in the previous task. The situation is similar.

    let messages = [
    {text: "Hello", from: "John"},
    {text: "How goes?", from: "John"},
    {text: "See you soon", from: "Alice"}
    ];
    The question now is: which data structure you’d suggest to store the information: “when the message was read?”.

    In the previous task we only needed to store the “yes/no” fact. Now we need to store the date and it, once again, should
    disappear if the message is gone.</p>
