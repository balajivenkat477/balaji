    <p>Anagrams are words that have the same number of same letters, but in different order.

    For instance:

    nap - pan
    ear - are - era
    cheaters - hectares - teachers
    Write a function aclean(arr) that returns an array cleaned from anagrams.

    For instance:

    let arr = ["nap", "teachers", "cheaters", "PAN", "ear", "era", "hectares"];

    alert( aclean(arr) ); // "nap,teachers,ear" or "PAN,cheaters,era"
    From every anagram group should remain only one word, no matter which one.</p>
